## Features
Description Genius brings the latest advances in Generative AI in an easy to use package.

The interactive UI lets you upload a CSV file containing a list of your products alongside their features. An example CSV file could look like this:

| Id | Color | Material | Product Group | Sizes | Price | Care Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Black | Leather | Pants | s/m/l | $250 | Hand wash |
| 2 | Purple | Cotton | Sweater | m | $99 | Machine washable at 45C |


## Getting Started
Description Genius comes with an easy to use UI built on top of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

To get started:
1) Clone this repository
2) Change to the project directory and install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3) Launch the app using `streamlit run app.py`


This should open up a browser window with the Description Genius UI. Simply upload a CSV file containing your product features alongside a prompt for the language model. Also provide a few examples of how your output should look like. Optionally, you can include additional sources of information such as styling guidelines, material information etc.

Once done, click on `Generate`. Description Genius will now generate your descriptions and output them in a table directly in the UI. You can now make any edits to the generated text and finally download it by clicking the `Download data as CSV` button.
